Over the course of this semester, the meaning of **“digital humanities”** has become crystal clear to me. I have a far better understanding of the field, which I now know is vastly diverse. At the beginning of the semester, I was apprehensive about writing a grant for a humanities project; I presumed I would have little interest in it, and that I would have to pick a “scholarly” topic that I genuinely do not care for. However, as the semester progressed, I realized that a lot of my interests do fit into this mold–by merging humanitarian topics of any sort with a digital aspect, you get a digital humanities project. 

The “readings” I enjoyed the most were typically not traditionally formatted readings. They were often projects that we read and interacted with to learn more about humanities or about how to write more concisely. I especially enjoyed using the [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/) and reading the project [“What Makes Writing More Readable.”](https://pudding.cool/2022/02/plain/) They kept my attention and the interactivity helped me realize that *that* is what makes a digital humanities project so interesting. If I am being completely honest, most of the other traditional readings I generally skimmed for a few important bits of information.

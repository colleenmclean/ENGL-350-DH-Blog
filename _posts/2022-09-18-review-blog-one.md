### Project Overview
The *Virtual Paul’s Cross Project* is a digital humanities project that aims to recreate religious sermons by seventeenth century English poet, John Donne. This project uses primary texts and scholarly resources to digitize St. Paul’s Cathedral on Gunpowder Day, November 5th 1622. The Virtual Paul’s Cross Project (VPCP) consists of multiple 3D models and rendered images of the cathedral itself, as well as reenacted audio files of Donne’s sermon. By putting these elements together, VPCP becomes an immersive historical experience catered to a modern audience. 

VPCP’s production team went for complete historical accuracy. Although it has been rebuilt and restored, St. Paul’s Cathedral was lost in 1666 during the Great Fire of London. In order to recreate Donne’s sermon on Gunpowder Day (Guy Fawkes Day) in 1622, the production team focused on recreating the cathedral’s original architecture. To make the experience more immersive, the audio files of Donne’s sermon were edited to be heard from “8 different positions in Paul’s Churchyard and in the presence of 4 different sizes of crowd.” By recreating this religious experience in vivid detail, it serves to preserve lost history. 


### Design and Accesibility
The Virtual Paul’s Cross Project site is visually appealing with a cohesive theme. It is divided into sections and subsections that are displayed at the top of the page. Although the site can be navigated by using the drop down tabs, the front page clearly states where visitors can find information by clicking the hyperlinks highlighted in red. When looking at this site for the first time, I followed the order which the front page recommended. For new visitors, I think the site could benefit from directing users to first look into an overview of the historical context before looking at the visual models and listening to the audio files. 

The individual pages of the site follow a cohesive format. The text is organized and  However, the gray text may appear too light against the site’s white background, and for some this may be difficult to see. Additionally, none of the images in this project have Alt-Text for screen readers. 

### Unnamed Section
The site is full of images, which makes the site feel like a historical gallery–it is satisfying to see how the production team utilized these primary sources to create the 3D models. While all the images used are of high quality, some of the images do not display properly. I first noticed this on the Framework tab (beneath Overview) in which Figure 7 is represented by a broken image icon. However, it is possible to access Figure 7 by hovering over the icon and clicking on it or clicking and dragging it to another browser tab. This issue is more prominent on the Installations tab where half of the images are broken, but they can be fixed in the same manner as aforementioned. Even with these broken images, the site’s greatest asset is still its use of primary source diagrams and rendered images of the 3D modeling.

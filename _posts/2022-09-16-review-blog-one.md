### Project Overview
The *Virtual Paul’s Cross Project* is a digital humanities project that aims to recreate religious sermons by seventeenth century English poet, John Donne. This project uses primary texts and scholarly resources to digitize St. Paul’s Cathedral on Gunpowder Day, November 5th 1622. The *Virtual Paul’s Cross Project* (VPCP) consists of multiple 3D models and rendered images of the digitally reconstructed cathedral, as well as reenacted audio files of Donne’s sermon for the occasion. By putting these elements together, *VPCP* becomes an immersive historical experience catered to a modern audience. 


### Context and Data
*VPCP*’s production team went for complete historical accuracy. Although the cathedral was been rebuilt and restored in 1697, St. Paul’s Cathedral was lost in 1666 during the Great Fire of London. In order to recreate Donne’s sermon on Gunpowder Day (Guy Fawkes Day) in 1622, the production team focused on recreating the cathedral’s original architecture. To make the experience more immersive, the audio files of Donne’s sermon were edited to be heard from “8 different positions in Paul’s Churchyard and in the presence of 4 different sizes of crowd.” By recreating this religious experience in such vivid detail, it serves to preserve lost history. 

*VPCP* does an excellent job of integrating historical information throughout the entirety of the site. The data is organized in a way that shows how it influenced specific aspects of the 3D models and audio samples. The project relies heavily on figures and images (which are all paired with their sources). All of the citations can be found on the "*Works Cited*" section under the "*Support*" tab. While these citations are organized, none of them are hyperlinked for site visitors to access.


### Technology

#### Visuals
The production team behind *VPCP* used multiple programs for both their visual models and audio samples. Lead visual designers, Joshua Stephens and Jordan Gray, used Google SketchUp for the base of the visual model and rendered it in Adobe Photoshop. To develop the virtual reality 3D model they first made it viewable in a "3D Virtual Reality environment," then transfered the model into Unreal Engine, a game engine developed by *Epic Games*. The figures of the various visual models are very impressive and clearly show the creative process; however, only one of the visual model links on YouTube is available. Additionally, the video does not have sound or closed captions. 

#### Acoustics
The acoustic model was designed by Ben Markham and Matt Azevedo, two acoustic engineers with Acentech Incorporated. They worked on the audio samples in CATT-Acoustic modeling program by using the dimensions of Stephen's simpler models in Google SketchUp. Although it is impossible to know what John Donne sounded like, they chose a voice actor with strong and clear speech. The engineers then used complex mathemetics and physics to calculate the decibels for each perspective in the crowd. The audio samples of the crowd are properly labeled and work flawlessly with a pause/play function, time stamps, and volume bar. The speed can be changed and the samples can be downloaded. When combinded with the audio of Donne's sermon under "*Explore Audibility*" under the "*Acoustics*" tab, the experience is immersive and intruiging with its quality and clarity. However, the automated closed captions for the videos are mostly incorrect. 


### Design and Accesibility
The Virtual Paul’s Cross Project site is visually appealing with a cohesive theme. It is divided into sections and subsections that are displayed at the top of the page. Although the site can be navigated by using the drop down tabs, the front page clearly states where visitors can find information by clicking the hyperlinks highlighted in red. When looking at this site for the first time, I followed the order which the front page recommended. For new visitors, I think the site could benefit from directing users to first look into an overview of the historical context before looking at the visual models and listening to the audio files. 

The individual pages of the site follow a cohesive format. The text is organized with headings, subheadings, and bolded text. The sentences are mostly easy to read. However, the gray text may appear too light against the site’s white background, and for some this may be difficult to see. Additionally, none of the images or figures in this project's blog have Alt-Text for screen readers. 


### Unnamed Section
The site is full of images, which makes the site feel like a historical gallery–it is satisfying to see how the production team utilized these primary sources to create the 3D models. While all the images used are of high quality, some of the images do not display properly. I first noticed this on the Framework tab (beneath Overview) in which Figure 7 is represented by a broken image icon. However, it is possible to access Figure 7 by hovering over the icon and clicking on it or clicking and dragging it to another browser tab. This issue is more prominent on the Installations tab where half of the images are broken, but they can be fixed in the same manner as aforementioned. Even with these broken images, the site’s greatest asset is still its use of primary source diagrams and rendered images of the 3D modeling.

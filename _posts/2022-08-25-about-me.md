My name is **Colleen McLean**, I am twenty-one years old, and working towards my BA in English with a concentration in Writing at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/). 

### English Endeavors
My passions lie in the arts and humanities, but creative writing is both a hobby and career goal for me. I have studied a multitude of writing styles in CNU’s Advanced Creative Writing Workshop, and my favorite writing course (so far) has been Creative Nonfiction. Although I aspire to be an author in fiction or memoir, working on any asset of the creative writing process is a fulfilling endeavor. I am currently taking the training course for Tutoring in the Writing Center and am excited to explore possibilities in assisting students with their writing. Editing and ghostwriting are other creative paths I am looking into. 

Although I specialize in writing, I also love to read! I am extremely active on BookTok and have been considering starting an account of my own to share my book recommendations, book reviews, and aesthetic clips of my meticulously organized bookshelves.

I’ve recently taken an interest in Japanese fiction and literature, and have read many popular works by [Osamu Dazai](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1UEAD_enUS970US970&sxsrf=ALiCzsY16tztEZY9xJrogHqX75IgKUVqiA:1661888837423&q=No+Longer+Human&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLUz9U3MLTMyE1TAjNT0uItK7WkspOt9JPy87P1E0tLMvKLrEDsYoX8vJzKRaz8fvkKPvl56alFCh6luYl5O1gZAaMo8mtJAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjA1r2uqu_5AhVCElkFHeabDrYQgOQBegQIGBAE&biw=1536&bih=873&dpr=1#) and [Haruki Murakami](https://www.harukimurakami.com/). I am currently reading [*Heaven*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_(Kawakami_novel)) by Japanese author Mieko Kawakami and [*Babel*](https://rfkuang.com/) by Chinese-American writer R. F. Kuang. I think it is especially important for those interested in English to study literary works from other countries and cultures. I would be interested in doing a DH project with Japanese literature in some capacity.

My knowledge of the Digital Humanities is limited, but I enjoy both the humanities and technology. Before taking this course I had already done projects utilizing Markdown and HTML (thanks Tumblr), and was already semi-familiar with GitHub and coding (thanks Computer Science major boyfriend). 

### Activities at CNU

Although I am not involved much in campus life (commuter student), I currently work in the David Student Union as a building supervisor! I usually work afternoons and frequently complain about having to wear red shirts and khaki pants (I feel like a Target employee), but the job is a great gig! Due to the importance of my role, I am trained in First Aid and was recently CPR certified. 

My interests in the humanities are not limited to writing and literature; I also watercolor paint in my free time! I find painting highly therapeutic; I also drink herbal tea and meditate to calm my anxiety. Although I paint recreationally, one of my paintings titled *'Churchill'* is set to be the cover of the 2022 edition of CNU’s literary magazine, [*Currents*](https://currentsliterarymagazine.weebly.com/about.html).

### Personal Life

Before transferring to CNU in 2020, I attended [Lone Star Community College](https://www.lonestar.edu/) and was born and raised in Houston, TX. My childhood was full of great barbeque and annual trips to the Rodeo & Livestock Show. Although I am allergic to cats, I currently have one named Felix who lives in Houston with my mother and step-father. Felix owns the house, but we also have a dog named Charlotte. I have two step-brothers: Austin, who is a music producer in Los Angeles, and Diego, who is a college junior and baseball player for UT at Dallas. 

My “guilty” pleasures (I am not actually guilty about any of these) are manga (my favorites are *Naruto*, *Nana*, and *Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku*), the Twilight Saga, and french fries.

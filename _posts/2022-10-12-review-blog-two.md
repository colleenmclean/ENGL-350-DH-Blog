## Project Overview

*Labor Rights and Considerations in ESports* is a digital humanities project that aims to showcase the world of ESports through a legal lens; in doing so, it is able to spread awareness on corruption within the industry that directly harms ESports professionals. 

The site focuses on the lack of resources available to ESports professionals, and how this leads players to fall victim to a toxic workplace environment with little restrictions and legal protections. The industry encourages overworking and unpaid practice, which inevitably leads to burnout. By looking at the fine print of multiple ESports organizations and collectives, it is clear the industry only exacerbates these problematic conditions. In exposing the industry, site visitors will see that these ESports professionals are vulnerable to countless pitfalls and have few legal rights as workers–similar to the nature of *League of Legends* itself, the pro-scene is a cutthroat, “high risk, high reward” environment. 

The project is showcased in a blog format with pages of data that the project creator, Joey Illuzzi, uses to make effective claims against Riot Games’ corrupt policies and business decisions. Illuzzi integrates two timelines into this project: one displays a complete history of all competitive rulings, and the other showcases examples of “unsatisfactory labor conditions and power dynamics.” 


## Context and Data

Labor Rights and Considerations in ESports (*LRCE*) focuses on the League of Legends Championship Series, otherwise known as the *LCS*–it is one of the highest seed brackets for competitive League of Legends (*LoL*), and is based in North America. 

Illuzzi states multiple times throughout the project that while foreign divisions of this particular ESport may face similar labor issues, he chose to focus on the LCS because other regions (namely the LCK, League of Legends Champions Korea) do not have as much information published in English [(see *Project Limitations*)](https://joeyilluzzi.github.io/future.html). Although my project grant focuses on the influence of South Korea in ESports, Illuzzi infers that it is likely other professional leagues face similar issues.

Illuzzi uses multiple scholarly sources throughout the blog, most of which can be found in [this literature review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VW16qG9pJhrfGzhiNR4CSomrPc0bFkxi/view). Other sources (videos, blogs, and articles) are hyperlinked throughout the project. However, since the site has not been updated since 2019, some of the information may be outdated or unavailable. This is especially prevalent in the site’s timeline–while all of the textual information is there, multiple cited videos and images are broken and cannot be retrieved. 


## Technology

LRCE was coded in GitHub using HTML5, while both timelines were made using Northwestern University’s [Knight Lab](https://timeline.knightlab.com) application. 

Before reviewing the technological components of the project, it is worth mentioning that the site’s URL (https://joeyilluzzi.github.io/index.html) is unfitting for all the ESports content provided. Since the URL is simply the name of the project creator, this made the project extremely difficult to find online; this may hinder traffic to the site. 

Both timelines in this project serve great purpose and provide a surplus of recorded data. By using a timeline format to showcase information, site visitors can see the progression of decisions and rulings made by Riot Games and how they affected other rulings over the course of eight years. 

The Knight Lab timeline application allows users to showcase the month and year an event occurred, as well as implement another column to further organize and contextualize the data. In the case of this project, the extra column organizes the rulings by tournament bracket and season. While it might have been helpful to provide context on the LCS seasonal structure for visitors who are unfamiliar with it, adding this extra component shows how in-depth Illuzzi researched the events. 

The timeline can be used by clicking on the white arrows in the large text box to go backwards or forwards. Additionally, by scrolling down to the larger view of the timeline beneath the text box, specific events can be clicked on to go directly to them. However, it may be difficult to use this feature in order to look for a specific type of ruling, since many of the titles are cut off due to space constraints. 

The second timeline (insert title) has better usability than the first, since all images and videos but one can be accessed. Many of the images and videos on the first timeline either have broken links, have been removed due to copyright restrictions, or (in the instance of some of the YouTube videos) have been privated on their parent sites. 

Even with these drawbacks, the timeline is extremely important and useful to Illuzzi’s research. For my own grant project, I think implementing a similar timeline of events in South Korean ESports history would be very beneficial to the project’s overall clarity.
